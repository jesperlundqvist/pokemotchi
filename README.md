# Pokémotchi

This a mobile app called Pokémotchi. (description here).
We used React native and Expo to develop this app.

## How to Pokemotchi

In this version there's unfortunately a bug and to avoid it you have to refresh the app as soon as you create an account for the first time. This is because when we fetch from asyncstorage for the first time an empty string is being fetched as the username. We will look into this problem as soon as we have time!


TWO SIMPLE STEPS:

    npm install

AND THEN

    npm start
